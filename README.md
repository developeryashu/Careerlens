## About My Build
# CareerLens - Executive Summary

**CareerLens** is an AI-powered SaaS platform that helps job seekers optimize their professional profiles and increase their chances of landing interviews.

## Core Value Proposition

CareerLens provides intelligent, actionable analysis across two key areas:

1. **Resume Analysis** - Evaluates resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, provides section-by-section scoring, identifies skill gaps, and suggests improvements with priority levels based on job descriptions.
2. **Portfolio Evaluation** - Assesses professional online presence (LinkedIn, GitHub, personal websites) across completeness, professionalism, content quality, and visibility, with specific recommendations for improvement.


## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis** using Claude AI for intelligent insights
- **User Authentication** with Supabase for secure account management
- **File Upload Support** for multiple resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- **Analysis History** tracking all past evaluations with scores and progress
- **Tiered Pricing Model** (Free, Pro, Enterprise) to serve different user segments
- **Dark/Light Mode** for accessibility and user preference


## Technical Stack

Built on modern, scalable technologies: Next.js 16, Supabase (PostgreSQL), AI SDK 6, and deployed on Vercel.

## Target Market

Job seekers, career changers, and professionals looking to improve their market competitiveness and interview success rates.
